# wrst

Build **smartwatch apps** with TypeScript and JSX - one codebase that runs on
**Wear OS** and **Apple Watch**.

You write React-style components; wrst bundles them, runs them inside QuickJS
embedded in a tiny native host, and renders the result with the platform's native
UI toolkit (Jetpack Compose on Wear OS, SwiftUI on Apple Watch).

> Early-stage. The core works end-to-end (dev + release on both platforms); the
> API surface is still small and evolving.

## Quickstart

```sh
npx wrst init my-app        # scaffold a project (src/, apple-watch/, wear-os/, wrst.config.ts)
cd my-app
npm install
npm start                   # dev server + hot reload (in one terminal)

# in another terminal, run on a watch (loads the bundle from the dev server):
npm run run:apple-watch     # boots a watchOS simulator, builds, installs, launches
npm run run:wear-os         # boots a Wear OS emulator, builds, installs, launches
```

Then edit `src/App.tsx` and watch it hot-reload on the watch.

```tsx
import {
  Text,
  Button,
  useState,
  VerticalView,
  Component,
  HorizontalView,
} from "wrst";

// Your app's root component. Components are plain functions returning a tree;
// state is reactive (useState), and the same code renders on Wear OS & Apple Watch.
const App: Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <HorizontalView
      style={{ verticalAlignment: "center", width: "fill", height: "fill" }}
    >
      <VerticalView style={{ horizontalAlignment: "center", width: "fill" }}>
        <Text style={{ color: "#ffffff" }}>{`Count: ${count}`}</Text>
        <Button onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          <Text style={{ color: "#FFF" }}>Increment</Text>
        </Button>
        <Button onPress={() => setCount(0)}>
          <Text style={{ color: "#F00" }}>Reset</Text>
        </Button>
      </VerticalView>
    </HorizontalView>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Commands

Run with the `wrst` CLI (or the matching `npm run` script in a scaffolded project):

| Command              | What it does                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wrst init <name>`   | Scaffold a new project in `./<name>`                            |
| `wrst start`         | Dev server + bundler with hot reload                            |
| `wrst run:apple-watch`   | Debug build + install + launch on a watchOS simulator (dev server) |
| `wrst run:wear-os`       | Debug build + install + launch on a Wear OS device/emulator (dev server) |
| `wrst build:apple-watch` | Debug build only, no install (the build half of `run:*`)    |
| `wrst build:wear-os`     | Debug build only, no install                                |
| `wrst build-release:apple-watch` | Release build (JS bundle embedded, runs offline)    |
| `wrst build-release:wear-os`     | Release build → APK (JS bundle embedded)            |
| `wrst sync`          | Apply `wrst.config.ts` (name, bundle id) to the native projects |
| `wrst help`          | List commands                                                   |

`run-*` / `build-*` boot a simulator/emulator if none is running.

## Configuration

`wrst.config.ts` is the source of truth for app identity. The CLI applies it to
the native projects on every `run`/`build` (and via `wrst sync`):

```ts
export default {
  name: "My App",
  entry: "src/entry.ts",
  ios: { bundleId: ".myapp" }, // leading dot: companion-style watch app
  android: { applicationId: "com.example.myapp" },
  server: { httpPort: 8091, wsPort: 8092 },
};
```

Don't hand-edit those name/id fields in Xcode/Gradle - wrst overwrites them.
Everything else in `apple-watch/` and `wear-os/` (icons, signing, permissions) is yours.

## How it works

```
TSX/JSX → esbuild bundle → QuickJS (in the native app) → JSON UI tree → native render
```

- **Dev:** the native app pulls the bundle from the dev server and hot-reloads.
- **Release:** the bundle is embedded in the app and loaded offline.

The runtime ships inside the `wrst` npm package - a prebuilt **AAR** for Android
and a **Swift package** for iOS - so your `apple-watch/`/`wear-os/` shells just reference
it from `node_modules`. The JS↔native wire format is documented in
[CONTRACT.md](./CONTRACT.md).

## Native modules (the extension hook)

The engine ships the universal, permission-light capabilities (timers, `fetch`,
`localStorage`, device info, ...). For anything that needs a platform framework or
a permission - sensors, HealthKit, Bluetooth, NFC - you register a **native
module** in your own thin shell, and call it from JS. **No engine fork, no engine
rebuild** - the runtime exposes one dispatch channel and your module rides it.

**JS** (anywhere in your app):

```ts
import { callNativeModule, getNativeModule } from "wrst";

const result = callNativeModule<string>("hello"); // -> "hello from native module"

// or a typed, reusable caller handle (the native side registers it; this just
// binds the name):
const hello = getNativeModule<[], string>("hello");
hello();
```

Args are JSON-serialized across the bridge and the return value is JSON-parsed
back. Register the module once, in the native shell:

Registration uses the **same call shape on both platforms** -
`WrstNativeModules.register(name) { ... }` - so adding a module is one register
call per side.

**Android** - `android/app/.../MainActivity.kt` (before `setContent`):

```kotlin
WrstNativeModules.register("hello") {
    Log.d("wrst", "hello from native module")
    "hello from native module"
}
```

**Apple Watch** - `ios/.../AppleWatchApp.swift` (in `init()`):

```swift
WrstNativeModules.register("hello") { _ in
    print("hello from native module")
    return "hello from native module"
}
```

The `example/` app ships exactly this under the **Native Module** menu screen.
For streaming data (e.g. sensor samples), a module calls back a registered JS
callback instead of returning - same mechanism as timers/`fetch`.

## Sensors

The **motion sensors** (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) are built into
the engine and need **no permission** on either platform - so they work in a
bare app with zero prompts. They're streams: subscribe with a callback, and
unsubscribe to stop (e.g. from a `useEffect` cleanup).

```tsx
import { Sensors, useState, useEffect } from "wrst";

const [a, setA] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, timestamp: 0 });

useEffect(() => {
  const sub = Sensors.accelerometer((s) => setA(s), { intervalMs: 200 });
  return () => sub.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

Units are normalized across platforms: accelerometer **m/s²**, gyroscope
**rad/s**, magnetometer **µT**; each sample is `{ x, y, z, timestamp }` (epoch
ms). There's also a generic `subscribeSensor(type, cb, opts)`. Permission-gated
sensors (heart rate, etc.) are native modules, not engine built-ins.

## Permissions

A bare app declares **no** permissions and prompts for nothing. To add one,
uncomment it in `wrst.config.ts` and do `wrst sync` (also run by `run-*`/`build-*`)
adds it to `ios/Info.plist` + `android/.../AndroidManifest.xml`, and **removes**
any you re-comment - so the config is the single source of truth.

```ts
// wrst.config.ts
permissions: {
  heartRate:  { reason: "Reads your heart rate." },   // iOS HealthKit · Android BODY_SENSORS
  location:   { reason: "Shows your route." },         // iOS Location · Android ACCESS_FINE/COARSE_LOCATION
  // activity / microphone / bluetooth / notifications also available
},
```

The `reason` is shown in the iOS permission dialog (Apple requires it; Android's
wording is system-set). Each permission maps to the right platform keys
automatically. Two notes: HealthKit (`heartRate` on iOS) also needs its
capability enabled in Xcode (beyond Info.plist), and the **runtime** request +
granted/denied result is handled by the sensor's native module, not the config.

## Companion apps (phone + watch)

A wrst watch app can run **standalone** or as a **companion** to a React Native
phone app (iOS + Apple Watch via WatchConnectivity, Android + Wear OS via the
Wearable Data Layer). The OS owns pairing; you only read the link status and
exchange messages.

Add a watch app to an existing RN project from its root:

```sh
npx wrst init --companion .
```

This detects **bare RN vs Expo**, generates the `wear-os/` module, sets up the
Apple Watch side (an [`@bacons/apple-targets`](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets)
target for Expo, or `apple-watch/` files + a one-time Xcode checklist for bare),
scaffolds the watch UI in `watch/` (+ `wrst.config.ts`), and adds the deps + npm
scripts. The phone bridge is [`react-native-wrst`](./packages/react-native-wrst).

**On the watch** (your `watch/` UI, authored with `wrst`):

```tsx
import { Companion } from "wrst";

if (Companion.isCompanionAvailable) Companion.sendMessage({ type: "getData" });
const sub = Companion.onMessage((msg) => { /* phone replied */ });
```

**On the phone** (your React Native code):

```ts
import { Companion } from "react-native-wrst";

const { available } = await Companion.getStatus();
Companion.onMessage((msg) => Companion.sendMessage({ data: /* ... */ }));
```

Both sides share one wire contract (capability `wrst_companion`, message path
`/wrst`, JSON payloads). The typical app pattern is 3-tier: **ask the phone** when
available → **`fetch()`** directly → **cached `localStorage`** offline. The
`example/` app's **Companion** screen shows it; signing stays manual on iOS.

## Requirements

- **Node** 20+
- **Android:** Android SDK + a Wear OS emulator/device (`adb`, `emulator` on PATH or `ANDROID_HOME` set)
- **Apple Watch:** macOS + Xcode (with a watchOS simulator)
